The Process.
**_ DO NOT forget to always check the docs and the project docs_**

Pre Setup -- We need a github repository!
-- Read through Project Docs!

1.) What library do I want to use?
React + Vite

2.) How do I install that?
npm create vite@latest
React + Javascript
cd into Project
npm Install
npm run dev to test

**_ DONT FORGET TO CLEAN OUT THE App.jsx, index.css, and App.css _**

3.) DO my Init commit(initial Commit)
I notice there are u's by my file and folder names
That means they are untracked by git-- the cloud version of my project isnt the same as my computer version

    *** Do Git Commands ***
      git add .
      git commit -m "init commit"
      git push

4.) Do I need components? Absolutely!
add a components folder
Is there a library of premade components I could use? Yes! MaterialUI
How do I get the library? npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
ProductList -- Home page
ProductDetails -- Shows details of Product
Cart -- cart to track thing a user buys
Navbar -- button to take me back to home

5.) Is there any Navigation on my Page? Yes!
Use react-router-dom to navigate between pages
Gotta look that up

6.) Do I need to track state? Yes!
Local Component State or Global State?
Well, is there multiple components that need 1 given state? Yes
Global State! Because a few of my components need the same state variable.
Global state means we will be using React Context or equivalent.
I should call my apis in the global state.

7.) Is there an API I need to call? Always!
Product List (20 products): https://fakestoreapi.com/products
Product Details by ID: https://fakestoreapi.com/products/{id}

**_ React Router Dom Notes _**

In order to set up a router to navigate pages within our React Project we must use React Router Dom.

We install it by using the npm package --- npm install react-router-dom

We will be creating a navigation hub in our App.jsx. We need three things to create a router --- Router, Routes, Route Components from react-router-dom.
We will be using the BrowserRouter for our Router. There can be only 1 router in our project. Every router has Routes, every Routes have individual route components. The outer most component must be our Router component(BrowserRouter)

BroswerRouter -- Opening and Closing tags
Routes -- Opening and Closing tags
Route -- self-closing

The Route component needs the following Properties:

- path="/url"
- element={componentToRender}
